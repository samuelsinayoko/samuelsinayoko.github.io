	abstract = {This paper presents a new formulation for trailing edge noise radiation from rotating blades based on an analytical solution of the convective wave equation. It accounts for distributed loading and the effect of mean flow and spanwise wavenumber. A commonly used theory due to Schlinker and Amiet predicts trailing edge noise radiation from rotating blades. However, different versions of the theory exist; it is not known which version is the correct one, and what the range of validity of the theory is. This paper addresses both questions by deriving Schlinker and Amiet's theory in a simple way and by comparing it with the new formulation, using model blade elements representative of a wind turbine, a cooling fan and an aircraft propeller. The correct form of Schlinker and Amiet's theory is identified. It is valid at high enough frequency, i.e. for a Helmholtz number relative to chord greater than one and a rotational frequency much smaller than the angular frequency of the noise sources.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5358},
	abstract = {This paper clarifies the nature of sound spectra within subsonic jets. Three problems, of increasing complexity, are presented. Firstly, a point source is placed in a two-dimensional plug flow and the sound field is obtained analytically. Secondly, a point source is embedded in a diverging axisymmetric jet and the sound field is obtained by solving the linearised Euler equations. Finally, an analysis of the acoustic waves propagating through a turbulent jet obtained by direct numerical simulation is presented. In each problem, the pressure or density field are analysed in the frequency-wavenumber domain. It is found that acoustic waves can be classified into three main frequency-dependent groups. A physical justification is provided for this classification. The main conclusion is that, at low Strouhal numbers, acoustic waves satisfy the {d'Alembertian} dispersion relation.},
