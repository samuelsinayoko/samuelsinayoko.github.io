  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the development of a theoretical model
	for the prediction of the sound radiated by serrated trailing-edges.
	The proposed model is based on Fourier expansion and Amiet's formulation.
	By using an iterative PDE-solving procedure, the scattered pressure
	field on the surface of an airfoil with sawtooth trailing-edge serrations
	is obtained. The far-field sound is then evaluated using the surface
	pressure integral based on the theories of Kirchhoff and Curle. The
	power spectral density (PSD) of the far-field sound is then related
	to the wavenumber spectral density of the hypothetical surface pressure
	under the turbulent boundary layer that would exist when the trailing-edge
	is absent. Numerical evaluation of the new model has shown better
	agreement than that obtained using Howe's model. Based on the new
	model, the sound reduction achieved by a trailing-edge with sharp
	sawtooth serrations is around 5-10 dB for a wide frequency range.
	This result better agrees with experiments, in which the average
	sound reduction is reported to be 5-7 dB. The results obtained using
	the new analytical model also agree well with FEM computations, suggesting
	that the model developed in this paper can capture the essential
	physics and give correct predictions for the sound generated by serrated
	trailing- edges. In the end, the physical mechanism of noise reduction
	is found to be the destructive interference effect of the scattered
	pressure field.},

  booktitle = {Euronoise 2015, 01--03 June 2015, Maastricht, Netherlands},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new simplied approach for the prediction of
	the acoustic shielding from lifting bodies by means of a finite element
	method. It extends a method already validated for aerodynamic applications
	to Aeroacoustics on the basis of the small perturbation expansion.
	A numerical model to represent the effect of the circulation developed
	by a slender body on the noise radiation in an unbounded domain is
	provided. A quasi-potential flow formulation is adopted by introducing
	a simplied shear layer model: a frozen wake with finite thickness
	and extent. The effect of the sound diffraction in the wake region
	is accounted for by applying the continuity of pressure across the
	wake line in the aeroacoustic field. An incompressible steady mean
	flow is considered and the Kutta condition is applied to overcome
	the singularity at the trailing edge. The circulation in the mean
	flow is predicted by reducing the potential solution to a single-valued
	problem. The non-uniform base flow is superimposed on the wave propagation
	and the linear aeroacoustic problem is solved by means of the full
	acoustic potential equation. The nite element method is applied both
	to the solution of the base flow and to the acoustic radiation. The
	acoustic eld scattered by a 2D airfoil from a line source in presence
	of a non-uniform base flow is predicted as a numerical example of
	the proposed model. The circulation modies the extent of the acoustic
	shielding by altering the wave propagation around the slender body,
	the wave diffraction at the trailing edge and the refraction in the
	shear layer.},

	Method (FEM)/Radiating-surface approach based on a Kirchhoff's integral
	for- mulation with a mean flow. This work identifies the sources
	of numerical error inherent to the hybrid method. A potential formulation
	is adopted for wave propagation and the problem is set in the frequency
	domain. The finite element method is applied to solve the scattering
	problem in presence of non-uniformities. The FEM solution, combined
	with a Perfectly Matched Layer (PML), is mapped on a closed surface.
	The Kirchhoff's radiating surface with a uniform mean flow propagates
	acoustic waves in free field. The problem of radiation from a monopole
	source and the scattering by a cylinder from the same source are
	presented as numerical examples by ac- counting for a subsonic mean
	flow. The accuracy in the prediction of the acoustic particle velocity
	is critical for the efficacy of the method. The main achievement
	is that the detrimental effect of the mean flow on the pollution
	error can be limited by applying the hybrid method. On the other
	hand, the integral formulation is exact only for a uniform mean flow.},

	for high speed blades remains poorly understood. For high speed blades,
	acceleration becomes significant and Amiet's popular model predicting
	broadband noise for rotating blades should become invalid. However,
	previous work suggests that Amiet's model may be applicable even
	to high speed rotating blades. Previous attempts at clarifying this
	issue have focused on modelling trailing ede noise in the frequency
	domain. However, this issue is best studied in the time domain and
	for the leading edge problem. This paper implements Amiet's blade
	response functions for leading edge noise in the time domain, using
	a convected form of the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings equations. This
	allows to easily pinpoint the contribution of acceleration on aerofoil
	broadband noise. Results show that acceleration can be neglected
	for high speed propellers when the ratio of frequency over rotor
	angular velocity is larger than ten percent.},

  abstract = {The FW-H equations allow to extrapolate acoustic fluctuations outside
	of a particular surface. In many applications, such as jet noise
	or turbomachinary noise, parts of the surface may lie in regions
	of high vorticity. Vorticity crossing the surface generates spurious
	noise sources in the thickness and loading terms. These sources are
	cancelled out by the quadrupole sources outside of the surface. Unfortunately,
	these quadrupole sources are usually neglected which leads to incorrect
	noise predictions. A generalized form of the FW-H formulation was
	recently developed to overcome this problem. It relies on a distributed
	extrapolation zone, instead of a single surface. This paper applies
	this new theory to the simplified problem of a divergence-free Gaussian
	vortex crossing a spherical FW-H surface. It is shown that the two
	key parameters driving the accuracy of the noise prediction are the
	distance between two outflow surfaces, which should be bigger than
	the characteristic length of the vortex, and the thickness of the
	outflow region, which should be small compared to the acoustic wavelength.
	Reductions in the sound pressure level of the spurious noise of up
	to 13 dB are obtained using 4 surfaces.},

  abstract = {Serrations have been widely studied in the case of stationary blades,
	as an efficient method for reducing trailing edge noise. However,
	most of the problems involving trail- ing edge noise are related
	to rotating blades and it is not known how rotation affects the efficiency
	of serrations. This paper tackles this problem using an efficient
	analytical model for predicting trailing edge noise radiation for
	rotating serrated blades. The model combines Howe's low Mach number
	isolated airfoil theory with Amiet's rotating airfoil technique.
	The paper also outlines a theory that generalizes Amiet's stationary
	airfoil the- ory to serrated trailing edges. Three different types
	of serrations ‚Äì sinusoidal, sawtooth and slitted-sawtooth ‚Äì are
	investigated for a model wind turbine blade element. The influence
	of the serrations width, depth, and slits, on noise radiation is
	compared to known results valid for stationary blades. The best serrations
	are narrow (relative to the boundary layer thickness) and deep. Rotation
	has been found to have little impact on the performance of serrations
	at low Mach numbers.},
