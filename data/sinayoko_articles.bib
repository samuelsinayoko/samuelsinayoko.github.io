  title = {A coherence-matched linear source mechanism for subsonic jet noise},
  journal = {Journal of Fluid Mechanics},
  year = {2015},
  volume = {776},
  pages = {235--267},
  abstract = {We investigate source mechanisms for subsonic jet noise using experimentally
	obtained data-sets of high Reynolds number, Mach 0.4 and 0.6 turbulent
	jets. The focus is on the axisymmetric mode which dominates downstream
	sound radiation for low polar an- gles and the frequency range at
	which peak noise occurs. A Linearized Euler Equation (LEE) solver
	with an inflow boundary condition is used to generate single-frequency
	hydrodynamic instability waves and the resulting near-field fluctuations
	and far-field acoustics are compared with those from experiments
	and Linear Parabolized Stability Equations (LPSE) computations. It
	is found that near-field velocity fluctuations closely agree with
	experiments and LPSE up to the end of the potential core, downstream
	of which deviations occur but LEE results match experiments better
	than LPSE results. Both the near-field wave packets and the sound
	field are observed directly from LEE computations, but the far-field
	sound pressure levels obtained are more than an order of magnitude
	lower than experimental values despite close statistical agreement
	of the near hydrodynamic field upto the potential core region. We
	explore the possibility that this discrepancy is due to the mismatch
	between the decay of two-point coherence with increasing distance
	in experimental flow fluctuations and the perfect coherence in linear
	models. To match the near-field coherence, experimentally obtained
	coherence profiles are imposed on the two-point cross-spectral density
	(CSD) at cylindrical and conical surfaces which enclose near-field
	structures generated with LEE. The surface pressure is propagated
	to the far-field using boundary value formulations based on the linear
	wave equation. Coherence-matching yields far-field sound pressure
	levels which show improved agreement with experimental results, indicating
	that coherence-decay is the main missing component in linear models.
	The CSD on the enclosing surfaces reveals that applying a decaying
	coherence profile spreads the hydrodynamic component of the linear
	wave packet source on to acoustic wavenumbers, resulting in a more
	efficient acoustic source.},

  title = {Prediction of noise from serrated trailing-edges},
  journal = {Submitted to Journal of Fluid Mechanics},
  year = {2015},
  note = {arXiv: 1508.02276},
  abstract = {A new analytical model is developed for the prediction of noise from
	serrated trailing-edges. The model generalizes Amiet's trailing-edge
	noise theory to sawtooth trailing-edges, resulting in an inhomogeneous
	partial differential equation. The equation is then solved by means
	of a Fourier expansion technique combined with an iterative procedure.
	The solution is validated through comparison with finite element
	method for a variety of serrations at different Mach numbers. Results
	obtained using the new model predict noise reduction of up to 10
	dB at 90 degree above the trailing-edge, which is more realistic
	than predictions based on Howe's model and also more consistent with
	experimental observations. A thorough analytical and numerical analysis
	of the physical mechanism is carried out and suggests that the noise
	reduction due to serration originates primarily from interference
	effects near the trailing-edge. A closer inspection of the proposed
	mathematical model has led to the development of two criteria for
	the effectiveness of the trailing-edge serrations, consistent but
	more general than those proposed by Howe. While experimental investigations
	often focus on noise reduction at ninety degrees above the trailing-edge,
	the new analytical model shows that the destructive interference
	scattering effects due to the serrations cause significant noise
	reduction at large polar angles, near the leading edge. It has also
	been observed that serrations can significantly change the directivity
	characteristics of the aerofoil at high frequencies and even lead
	to noise increase at high Mach numbers.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the nature of sound spectra within subsonic jets.
	Three problems of increasing complexity are presented. First, a point
	source is placed in a two-dimensional plug flow and the sound field
	is obtained analytically. Second, a point source is embedded in a
	diverging axisymmetric jet and the sound field is obtained by solving
	the linearized Euler equations. Finally, an analysis of the acoustic
	waves propagating through a turbulent jet obtained by direct numerical
	simulation is presented. In each problem, the pressure or density
	field is analyzed in the frequency-wavenumber domain. It is found
	that acoustic waves can be classified into three main frequency-dependent
	groups. A physical justification is provided for this classification.
	The main conclusion is that, at low Strouhal numbers, acoustic waves
	satisfy the d\&apos;Alembertian dispersion relation.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new formulation for trailing edge noise radiation
	from rotating blades based on an analytical solution of the convective
	wave equation. It accounts for distributed loading and the effect
	of mean flow and spanwise wavenumber. A commonly used theory due
	to Schlinker and Amiet predicts trailing edge noise radiation from
	rotating blades. However, different versions of the theory exist;
	it is not known which version is the correct one, and what the range
	of validity of the theory is. This paper addresses both questions
	by deriving Schlinker and Amiet's theory in a simple way and by comparing
	it with the new formulation, using model blade elements representative
	of a wind turbine, a cooling fan and an aircraft propeller. The correct
	form of Schlinker and Amiet's theory is identified. It is valid at
	high enough frequency, i.e. for a Helmholtz number relative to chord
	greater than one and a rotational frequency much smaller than the
	angular frequency of the noise sources.},

	show that, by filtering the flow field by means of a linear convolution
	filter, it is possible to decompose the flow into non-radiating and
	radiating components. This is demonstrated on two different flows:
	one satisfying the linearised Euler equations and the other the Navier‚ÄìStokes

	through classical acoustic analogies in which the flow field is decomposed
